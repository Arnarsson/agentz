You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, agent development, and automated testing.

Key Principles:
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming for agent logic; avoid excessive state or complex inheritance.
- Agents should follow modular principles, allowing easy extension and reuse of components.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., process_task, is_ready, has_data).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., agents/task_agent.py).
- Favor named exports for agent functions and modules.
- Implement a Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern to simplify agent input/output.

Agent-Specific Development:
- Design agents to perform single, focused tasks effectively.
- Use event-driven patterns to manage agent workflows and communication.
- Log all agent actions with clear and structured messages for debugging.
- Use `async` and `await` where necessary for agents requiring concurrent operations.
- Incorporate timeouts and retries for external API calls or tasks prone to failure.
- Separate agent logic into:
  - Core functionality (e.g., task execution, decision-making).
  - Input/output handlers (e.g., message parsing, API integration).
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms.

Python/FastAPI:
- Use `async def` for all asynchronous operations, including agent workflows.
- Use type hints for all function signatures, especially for agent inputs and outputs.
- Prefer Pydantic models for validating agent data (e.g., request and response schemas).
- Separate request and response models to ensure clean data contracts.
- File structure: separate agents, utilities, schemas, and API endpoints into distinct directories.

FastAPI for Agent APIs:
- Use FastAPI to expose agent actions via APIs.
- Modularize routers for agent-related endpoints (e.g., `/agents/task`).
- Use FastAPI's dependency injection for shared components (e.g., database connections, cache).
- Document APIs with detailed OpenAPI specs, including example inputs and outputs.

Package Installation:
- Use Python 3.12 for maximum compatibility with CrewAI dependencies.
- Install the following core packages:
  - `pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic`
  - `pip install sqlalchemy chromadb` (for database and embeddings)
  - `pip install celery redis` (for task management)
  - `pip install onnxruntime replicate` (for AI model execution)
  - `pip install pulsar-client` (for messaging and event streaming)
- For automated UI testing:
  - `pip install playwright`
  - `playwright install`
- Optional:
  - `pip install loguru` (for advanced logging)
  - `pip install embedchain chromadb<0.5.0` (resolve version conflicts for embeddings)

Testing:
- Write unit tests for all agent logic and decision-making algorithms.
- Write integration tests for interactions between agents, APIs, and external services.
- Avoid manual user testing; incorporate Playwright for automated UI and bug testing:
  - Simulate agent interactions through the UI or APIs.
  - Verify workflows and responses for all supported use cases.
  - Validate UI consistency, responsiveness, and dynamic agent behavior.
- Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies during tests to isolate agent behavior.

Error Handling:
- Implement centralized error handling for agents to log and recover from failures.
- Use structured logs for agent actions and errors, including timestamps and error categories.
- Implement global exception handlers for FastAPI endpoints serving agents.
- Include fallback mechanisms for agents in case of failure (e.g., retries, alerts).

Documentation:
- Use OpenAPI to auto-generate API documentation for agent-related endpoints.
- Provide example workflows for each agent in API documentation.
- Document internal agent logic with comments and diagrams for onboarding new developers.

Project Organization:
- Use lowercase, underscore-separated file and directory names (e.g., task_agent.py).
- Maintain a scalable project structure:
  - `agents/`: Core agent logic and task execution.
  - `schemas/`: Pydantic models for data validation.
  - `services/`: Utility functions or shared business logic for agents.
  - `routers/`: API endpoints for agent interactions.
  - `tests/`: Unit, integration, and Playwright tests for agents and UI.

Playwright Testing for Agents:
- Automate testing for UI interactions and workflows involving agents.
- Simulate edge cases like invalid inputs, timeouts, and system overloads.
- Validate agent-driven actions through UI workflows (e.g., status updates, task completion).
- Ensure all agent APIs and UIs are bug-free and follow expected behavior under load.

Other Guidelines:
- Use environment variables for agent-specific configurations (e.g., API keys, timeouts).
- Minimize hardcoding in agent logic; use configuration files or centralized settings.
- Automate repetitive tasks in development and testing to reduce manual intervention.
- Focus on scalability and maintainability in agent workflows, APIs, and UIs.
- Use `async def` for all asynchronous operations, including agent workflows.
- Use type hints for all function signatures.
- Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
