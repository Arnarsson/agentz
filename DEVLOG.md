# Development Log

## [2024-01-XX] - Initial Setup and Core Features
- Set up FastAPI backend structure
- Implemented basic agent management (CRUD operations)
- Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Configured structured logging and error handling
- Implemented task history and analytics
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff

## [2024-01-XX] - Documentation and Testing
- Created initial API documentation
- Added WebSocket protocol documentation
- Implemented service and API tests
- Added WebSocket connection tests
- Created development guide

## Current Focus
1. Security Improvements
   - [ ] Implement API authentication
   - [ ] Add rate limiting
   - [ ] Configure security headers
   - [ ] Set up error tracking

2. Performance Optimization
   - [ ] Set up Redis caching
   - [ ] Implement database optimization
   - [ ] Configure API caching
   - [ ] Add system health checks

3. Testing Enhancement
   - [ ] Set up frontend testing framework
   - [ ] Configure E2E testing with Playwright
   - [ ] Complete CI/CD pipeline

4. Documentation Completion
   - [ ] Complete API documentation
   - [ ] Update WebSocket protocol docs
   - [ ] Finalize setup instructions
   - [ ] Complete developer guide

## Known Issues
1. Security
   - Missing API authentication
   - No rate limiting implementation
   - Security headers not configured

2. Performance
   - No caching mechanism in place
   - Database queries not optimized
   - Missing health check endpoints

3. Testing
   - Frontend tests not implemented
   - E2E tests not configured
   - Incomplete CI/CD pipeline

4. Documentation
   - Some API endpoints not documented
   - Missing detailed setup instructions
   - Incomplete developer guide

## Next Steps
1. Implement API authentication using JWT
2. Set up rate limiting with Redis
3. Configure security headers
4. Implement health check endpoints
5. Set up frontend testing framework
