# Development Log

## [2024-01-08] - Database Configuration and Environment Setup
- Configured SQLite for local development
- Set up Alembic for database migrations
- Updated environment variables configuration
- Implemented database URL handling for different environments
- Added support for both sync and async database connections
- Configured logging with Loguru

## [2024-01-XX] - Initial Setup and Core Features
- Set up FastAPI backend structure
- Implemented basic agent management (CRUD operations)
- Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Configured structured logging and error handling
- Implemented task history and analytics
- Added retry mechanism with exponential backoff

## [2024-01-XX] - Documentation and Testing
- Created initial API documentation
- Added WebSocket protocol documentation
- Implemented service and API tests
- Added WebSocket connection tests
- Created development guide

## Current Focus
1. Database Migration
   - [x] Configure SQLite for local development
   - [x] Set up Alembic migrations
   - [ ] Create initial database schema
   - [ ] Add database indexes

2. Security Improvements
   - [x] Configure environment variables
   - [ ] Implement API authentication
   - [ ] Add rate limiting
   - [ ] Configure security headers
   - [ ] Set up error tracking

3. Performance Optimization
   - [ ] Set up Redis caching
   - [ ] Implement database optimization
   - [ ] Configure API caching
   - [ ] Add system health checks

4. Testing Enhancement
   - [ ] Set up frontend testing framework
   - [ ] Configure E2E testing with Playwright
   - [ ] Complete CI/CD pipeline

5. Documentation Completion
   - [ ] Complete API documentation
   - [ ] Update WebSocket protocol docs
   - [ ] Finalize setup instructions
   - [ ] Complete developer guide

## Known Issues
1. Database
   - Initial migration pending
   - Database indexes not optimized
   - Connection pooling needs tuning

2. Security
   - Missing API authentication
   - No rate limiting implementation
   - Security headers not configured

3. Performance
   - No caching mechanism in place
   - Database queries not optimized
   - Missing health check endpoints

4. Testing
   - Frontend tests not implemented
   - E2E tests not configured
   - Incomplete CI/CD pipeline

5. Documentation
   - Some API endpoints not documented
   - Missing detailed setup instructions
   - Incomplete developer guide

## Next Steps
1. Create initial database migration for agents and tasks
2. Implement API authentication using JWT
3. Set up rate limiting with Redis
4. Configure security headers
5. Implement health check endpoints
6. Set up frontend testing framework
